organize yourself
=================

In today's world, when so many things are happening in everyday life, it becomes little difficult to keep track of your activities on your computer. Overtime, you endup accumulating so many things on your computer, it become bit difficult to perform some cleaning. Usually I like to keep my computer organized and access limit to only useful items. As most of is will agree, performing daily cleanup is bit annoying, so I wrote few automator jobs to help me do some maintanance activities on my "Downloads" folder. 

Why "Downloads" folder?
If you are a mac user, you probably know already. If not, don't bother, as automator solution won't help you anyways.

So what exactly these automator jobs are doing?
So, here the deal. I have these 4 jobs running at 24 hour frequency, helping me lable all files under "Downloads" folder with different colors based last usage time. Over the time, lot of crap keeps accumulating under Downloads folder, these jobs lets me visually identify them, to perform a delete operation.

Files used < 1 month - blue lable
Files used < 6 month - yellow lable
Files used < 12 month - orange lable
Files used > 12 month - red lable

And usually in my case red files ends up in trash.
